              This small web application was created by me using HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. It allows a user to draw and paint on a virtual grid
              by pressing down on their cursor while hovering over the grid. The
              user interface allows users to change the size of the grid, change
              the color of the brush, set the brush to a randomized color mode,
              and clear the grid entirely. It was definitely a fun project to
              practice my development skills!

              This small web application was built and designed by me using
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took inspiration from the iOS
              calculator application and challenged myself to recreate it. To
              give it my own personal flare, I chose my own color palette. Since
              I built the app entirely from scratch, it was an interesting
              process trying to replicate the iOS calculator design and
              functionality from observations alone.

              JavaScript. It allows a user to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors
              against the computer. The first one to reach a score of 5 wins.
              Although this project was relatively simple, it was a good
              exercise in creating interactive webpages and implementing logic.

            <h3>A little about me</h3>
            <p>
              I've recently made the career switch to Full Stack Developer.
              After working in IT for a few years, I knew I wanted to work in
              technology but I was more interested in development, which led me
              to continue my education.
            </p>
            <p>
              I attended Sheridan College and completed a diploma in Software
              Engineering to build my development skills. After completing this
              program, I decided I wanted to focus on Full Stack Development
              since I enjoy the creative aspects of the field as well as
              crafting enjoyable user experiences. I have also recently
              completed a Web Development bootcamp on Udemy, which has helped
              build my skills in Full Stack development significantly.
            </p>
            <p>
              One more interesting thing I can bring to the table is that prior
              to working in IT, I completed a 4 year Bachelor's Degree at
              Sheridan College in Game Design. In this program I focused on
              learning a variety of different technologies, collaborating in
              teams to develop prototypes, creating detailed documentation,
              fixing bugs, and crafting interactive and engaging user
              experiences.

            <div>August 2020 - December 2020</div>
            <p>
              I had the opportunity to work at Toronto District School Board
              again at the Client Service Desk when they were in need of
              assistance due to high user inquiries. My previous experience at
              Field Services, as well as the SAPHR Help Desk, and my tech
              background proved to be of great benefit, allowing me to
              effectively and efficiently assist users remotely through web
              chats, email, and over the phone. I was also able to use my
              experience to provide leadership to the other new hires that were
              contracted at the same time as me. Once my contract was coming to
              an end, I decided it was time to pursue my dream of becoming a
              developer!

            <div>October 2018 - August 2019</div>
            <p>
              I moved up to a higher level help desk position where I developed
              training materials and trained staff on the use of SAPHR-related
              technologies. I also regularly had to attend team meetings to
              assist in creating training plans as well as documenting changes
              in business processes. When I was not working on training-related
              materials, I would troubleshoot user inquiries related to SAPHR
              and communicate with other teams/departments within the TDSB to
              resolve them. Due to government funding cuts, I moved on once my
              contract was completed.

            <h3>TDSB - Field Service Technician</h3>
            <div>April - August 2016, April - August 2018</div>
            <p>
              My first experience working in IT was with the Toronto District
              School Board. I was trained on the job and worked with other Field
              Service Technicians at numerous locations every day. I
              troubleshooted user issues on-site on a ticket-by-ticket basis.
              These issues ranged from diagnosing hardware/software issues,
              setting up new or existing devices, to replacing faulty equipment.
