                    <p>
                        I've recently made the career switch to Front End Developer.
                        After working in IT for a few years, I knew I wanted to
                        work in technology but I was more interested in
                        development, which led me to continue my education.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I attended Sheridan College and completed a diploma in 
                        Software Engineering to build my development skills. 
                        After completing this program, I decided I wanted to focus
                        on Front End Development since I enjoy the creative aspects
                        of the field as well as crafting enjoyable user experiences. 
                        I have also recently completed a Web Development bootcamp
                        on Udemy, which has helped build my skills in Front End specifically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One more interesting thing I can bring to the table is that 
                        prior to working in IT, I completed a 4 year Bachelor's Degree at 
                        Sheridan College in Game Design. In this program I focused on learning
                        a variety of different technologies, collaborating in teams to develop
                        prototypes, creating detailed documentation, fixing bugs, and crafting
                        interactive and engaging user experiences.

                    <p>
                        My first experience working in IT was with the Toronto
                        District School Board. I was trained
                        on the job and worked with other Field Service Technicians
                        at numerous locations every day. I troubleshooted user issues
                        on-site on a ticket-by-ticket basis. These issues ranged 
                        from diagnosing hardware/software issues, setting up 
                        new or existing devices, to replacing faulty equipment.

                    <p>
                        I had the opportunity to work at the Client Service Desk
                        when they were in need of assistance due to high user inquiries.
                        This was my first experience working at a help desk and I was 
                        once again trained on the job. My previous experience at
                        Field Services and my tech background proved to be of great benefit,
                        allowing me to effectively and efficiently assist users 
                        remotely through web chats, email, and over the phone.

                    <div>December 2018 - May 2020</div>
                    <p>
                        I moved up to a higher level help desk position where 
                        I developed training materials and trained staff on the use of
                        SAPHR-related technologies. I also regularly had to attend team meetings
                        to assist in creating training plans as well as documenting changes in 
                        business processes. When I was not working on training-related 
                        materials, I would troubleshoot user inquiries related to SAPHR and 
                        communicate with other teams/departments within the TDSB to resolve them.
